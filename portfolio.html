        <h2>Global Thermonuclear War</h2> is my most well-developed solo game, in terms of completeness, fluidity in
        style, and mechanic depth. In the first seven months after release, it got 1000 plays and over 2000 views on itch.io.
        <p>The game is a mostly-faithful recreation of the WOPR Global Thermonuclear War simulator from the movie War
            Games. Gameplay is fully text-based, featuring an ASCII-art GUI, animated text, and a companion manual to
            assist with gameplay. The game adjusts its difficulty (intelligence and response times) based on the
            players' skill, allowing for a naturally integrated difficulty scaling, always attempting to match the
            player's aggression in hopes of a no-winners scenario.</p>
        <p>I developed the game in a month, working solo, using the Phaser3 Phaser.js framework. My goal when creating
            this game was to cultivate an immersive experience that didn't operate off of knee-jerk skills or reaction
            times; I found the development experience much more enjoyable when it didn't require me to worry about a
            physics system, hitbox collisions, or something similar; I was able to fully invest my time into pushing for
            immersion, both in feelings of command-based, unusual gameplay and UI design. </p>
        <p>As probably expected, my largest challenge with this project was "student difficulty"; due to the game's
            non-traditional nature, a lot of my time was spent refining mechanics, language, and playability, so the
            game was comprehensible to someone who picked it up and spent ten minutes playing.</p>

        <h2>Slash & Burn</h2> was a collaborative project with a team of four for UCSC's Independent Gamedev Coalition
        club.</p>
        <p>Over the course of a quarter (ten weeks) we developed the game using Godot. We showcased the game at the
            Art for Games & Playable Media department-sponsored end-of-year games showcase under our club's banner!</p>
        <p>Slash & Burn is an arcade style play-till-you-lose "arena defense" type game where the player defends a
            central campfire from hordes of
            enemies spawning at the edges of a forest grove. The game's core mechanic is that each type of enemy can
            only be defeated by one type of
            weapon, and the player can only hold and throw one weapon at a time, leading to high-focus scenarios in
            which the player must prioritize weapon placement and ideal pathing.</p>
        <p>My role in the project was fairly straightforwards; I headed UI design, enemy spawning & pathing, wave
            management, and the firepit. Some unique challenges I was presented with during this project were the
            limitations and confusions of working within Godot; my team decided to work with Godot to broaden our
            horizons, since we'd never used it as a tool before. Additionally, it was the first time I'd seriously
            published to itch.io, so a lot of care was taken into making sure the game was suitable for web-browser
            play.</p>
