        <h2>The Song of Polaris</h2>
        <p>is a tabletop RPG system I built from the ground up as an alternative to the D&D 5th edition framework, and
            I'm currently running a campaign using it! I wanted to create a gameplay space for my players to have
            full-spectrum customization over their characters, with significantly less downtime during combat, and more
            opportunities for meaningful free-form roleplay. The story takes place in a magical,
            post-apocalyptic world faced with the threat of annihilation by an elder Greatsoul, and the players are
            rushing to fulfill a prophecy gone sideways.</p>
        <p>This was my first time writing a full ruleset, and I drew heavy inspiration from the D&D 5e core books,
            Starfinder, Pok√©mon games, and other roleplay systems I've encountered or used in the past. As we
            play, I am constantly editing, fine-tuning, and fixing the rulebook, but the most recent version can be
            found <a href="/files/1.1.1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>! Feel free to take a look. </p>

        <h2>Balatro: En Carde</h2>
        <p>is a prototype player-versus-player tabletop edition of the indie roguelike game <a
                href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/" target="_blank">Balatro</a>. Originally
            coined as "joker poker", Balatro is a "poker-inspired roguelike deck builder all about creating powerful
            synergies and winning big".</p>
        <p>Balatro: En Carde takes it one step further, wrapping the game around back to a competitive card game,
            keeping the additions of Balatro's powerful Jokers, Tarot Cards, and newly possible hands. Beginning with a
            standard deck of cards each (and a reserve deck to spare) players must simultaneously craft the best poker
            hand to win each Ante, utilizing and competing over advantageous Jokers and Tarot Cards.
        </p>
        <p>You can read the rules <a target="_blank" href="/files/Balatro_ En Carde 1.0.1.pdf">here</a> and play with
            your
            friends and
            family! Do note that the game is a prototype and has not been blind
            playtested, so there may be gaps in the rules that are yet to be accounted for. The Balatro property is
            owned by Playstack and LocalThunk.</p>

        <h2>Hades: The Darkride</h2>
        <p>is a two part paper proposal and simple state simulator for a theoretical amusement part attraction based on
            the
            Hades games (<a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/">I</a> & <a
                target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">II</a>). The ride is
            designed to create a
            highly immersive themed journey for riders using cutting edge technology; with an end result close to
            something like Disney's <a target="_blank"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Rise_of_the_Resistance">Star Wars:
                Rise of the Resistance</a>.
            <br><br>
            The paper proposal can be found <a target="_blank" href="files\Hades The Darkride.pdf">here</a>; it contains
            a link to the
            simulation.

        <h2>CMPM147: Generative Design Portfolio</h2>
        <p>is a  secondary portfolio that showcases my work during my time learning generative design. The class covered
            generative design both in games and art, but I focused heavily on world/level generation. My biggest
            takeaways from the class were learning how to mix and layer noise, and the different styles programmers use
            to generate complex and emergent buildings, structures, level layouts, and decorations.
        <br><br>
        Out of the projects I worked on in that time, my best were by far project 5, the image annealer, and Gem-etic
            Dungeon, the final project. Gem-etic Dungeon can also be found on my itch.io page.
        <br>The portfolio, as well as descriptions for the projects can be found <a
            href="https://alhinator.github.io/cmpm147/">here</a>!
